This is sandbox where I am working on building Powershell Desired State Configuration to enforce policy for SSL/TLS

The first files (in SSLVersion) are to enable a security officer or systems administrator to turn SSL versions on and off. With the recent POODLE vulnerabilities and the forthcoming TLS version 1.3, this is important capability. So far this is untested. I'll need to spin up some VMs and try it out.
